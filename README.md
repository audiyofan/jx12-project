# JX12 Project

JX12 is a secret audio project, this is why it has such stupid name. 

## What is this secret audio project ?

This is a very standard valve push pull amplifier using very common (and cheap) tubes. Instead of using a normal negative feedback it uses an extra valve to create a correction positive feedback. This particularity dramatically lowers the output impedance to levels rarely seen with valve amplifiers (<1Î©).
